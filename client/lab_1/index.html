            Why I'm excited to take this class
        </h2>
        <p>I am fascinated by <em>accessible</em> web development and always want to learn more.</p>
        <p>I am excited to learn more about how humans interact <strong>with technical systems</strong> in different ways</p>
        <p>I want to explore the different ways that we can <strong><em>support users when navigating different websites for the first time.</em></strong></p>

        <h2>
            My favorite poem
        </h2>
        <p>
            Then softly falls the word <br>
            Of one beyond a name, <br>
            "Peace only comes to him <br>
            Who guards his life from shame, — <br>
            "Who gives his heart to love, <br> 
            And holding truth for guide, <br>
            Girds him with fearless strength, <br>
            That freedom may abide." <br>
